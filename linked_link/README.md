# LINKED LIST

## Application of Linked List

+ worst case insertion at the end and begin are &#952;(1)
+ Worst case deletion from the beginning &theta;(1)
+ Insertion and deletions in the middle are &theta;(1) if we have reference to the previous node.
+ Round Robin Implementation
+ Merging two sorted linked  lists is faster than arrays.
+ Implementation of simple memory manager where we need to link free blocks.
+ Easier implementation of queue and Dequeue data structures.
