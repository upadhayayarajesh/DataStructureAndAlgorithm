# TREE

    Heirachircal structure.

## Terminology in Tree

+ Node : Items in the tree are node.
+ Root : Top node in the tree is root
+ Leaf : Node at the bottom of the tree is leaf nodes.
+ Child : Node which are below a node are called children
+ Parent : Node which are above a node are called parent
+ Subtree : A tree contain many trees inside it are called subtree.
+ Descendants : Descendant of a node are subtree with this node as tree.
+ Ancestors : An ancestor is any node that is on the path from the root of the tree to the specific node of interest,
  excluding the node itself.
+ Degree : Number of children it has.

## Application of Tree

+ To represent hierarchical data
    + Organization structure
    + Folder Structure
    + XML/HTML content (Json objects)
    + In OOP (Inheritance)
+ Binary Search Trees
+ Binary Heap
+ B and B+ Trees in DBMS
+ Spanning and Shortest path tree in computer networks
+ Parse tree, Expression tree in compilers

## Variation on Tree

- Trie
- Suffix Tree
- Binary Index Tree
- Segment Tree

## Binary  Tree

     Every node have at most 2 children.

## Tree Traversal

+ Breadth First Search(Level Traversal)
+ Depth First Search
    + Inorder : (Left, Root, Right)
    + Preorder : (Root, Left, Right)
    + Postorder : (Left, Right, Root)
